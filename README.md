# SeleniumExercisesRepo

- For simplicity I put all excercises in the main file, each exercise is inside a method. Please comment the method calls in the main class in order to run exercises one by one.

- Dependencies:
  - Firefox Gecko Driver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases.
  - Selenium libraries, you can either run the maven configuration using the pom.xml file included in the project or download and manually add the jars to the project: https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/.
